## About this Project
CE-rent was developed as a comprehensive final project for the Web Design & Programming course, but my primary goal went beyond simply meeting requirements. I deliberately chose to build the application manually **without reliance on AI code generation** to gain a granular understanding of the Laravel framework.

### Booking Process
The application prioritizes a frictionless user experience (UX) starting with a **guest cart system**. I engineered a mechanism that allows unregistered guests to add items to their cart freely using temporary session storage. Once the guest user registers, this data merges seamlessly with their persistent account.

### Payment Flow

For financial transactions, I integrated the **Midtrans Payment Gateway** directly via their API. Rather than using pre-built wrappers, I manually implemented the request-response cycle to handle secure payments, ensuring the system can properly simulate transactions within the sandbox environment.

    { src: "/projects/ce-rent/checkout - payment successful.png", alt: "Payment Successful", caption: "Order Confirmation" }

### Dashboard

On the backend, I implemented a robust **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** system. This distinguishes between standard customers and administrators, granting the latter specific privileges to manage inventory, verify equipment returns, and calculate potential fines for late items.
